# GroupPortfolio
For our group portfolio, we brainstormed ways to be unique and creative. Our first attempt was in the team name and slogan. 
We came up with a creative way to combine all our initials together without being mainstream. 
Jialin combined all our insitials and connected them to relevant colors and then we blended the colors together and got a unique hex code.
That hex code is our team name and the color is the aesthetic we are going with (turquoise). 
Then we chose a simple, sleek design in which the user can get a good experience when on our site but at the same time it isn't too basic or too much.
We kept it simple with the images and brief descriptions under each person's image/name. Then used some css to add cool effects and design aspects to the simplicity.
Each image sends you to the relevant person's resume once clicked on. There you can get to know each of us and our background.
We got stuck on a few css parts where the images wouldn't line up or they weren't centered. Also having to connect the images to the resumes. But those were solved fairly quickly. Another part was combining all the css files together. It took a bit of effort but also wasnt that crazy.
